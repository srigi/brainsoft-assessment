## Requirements

You will need a unix machine with:
- Node.js v20
- corepack
- PostgreSQL v9+, use [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/) for minimalistic & effortless installation

This project is a monorepo with Yarn Berry workspaces, see [yarn getting started guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

# Getting started

1. clone the repository
2. copy [.env (example)](.env%20(example)) into `.env`<br />
   Change values in ENV file as needed.
3. no need to install dependencies,<br />
   This project is using [yarn's zero install](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs) topology.

   ```
5. seed database with data
    ```shell
